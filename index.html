            Enjoying novels is not always easy. Reading requires you to put
            effort into the novel otherwise you end up lost, bored, and
            confused. The best novels, however, always reward you for the
            effort, showing off a depth and power that you might have missed
            while skimming.

          Just the simple act of getting outdoors can improve your mental state.
          So if nature can make you happy, why not select a hobby that will get
          you outdoors more? There are both active and passive outdoor hobbies
          to choose from so select one that suits your personality.

        <em><span> Music </span></em>
        <p>
          This is why music can make you feel more joyful, optimistic, and
          inspired, as it triggers the release of dopamine in the brain.
          Listening to music as a hobby can not only enhance our creativity but
          also our productivity, attention, and focus.

        <em><span> Learning </em></span>
        <p>
          One way to learn a language through music is to listen to songs in the
          target language and try to follow along with the lyrics. You can also
          look up the lyrics and translations online to better understand the
          meaning of the words.
